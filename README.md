# PhotoEditor
This repository includes code for an image editor

Image files are input as Portable Pixel Map (PPM), and output as the same file. The program can rotate, flip, crop, englarge, shrink, and invert the input image, based on user specifications. 
Use GIMP inorder to view the images and create PPM files to edit.
